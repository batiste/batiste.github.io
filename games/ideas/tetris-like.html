<h1>Combo breaker - Tetris like</h1>

<h2>Basic Rules / Ideas</h2>

<ul>

<li>You have blocks of different colors/shape. When 3 of those blocks touch each other they breaks.</li>

<li>You have all the time you want to play every piece.</li>

<li>Every piece is a stick made of 3 blocks that you can rotate.</li>

<li>When you go forward with the game, you will get
more and more advanced type of blocks until the point where it becomes very difficult.
</li>

</ul>

<h2>Combos</h2>

<ul>

<li>When 5 or more block disapear in one break you get a length combo.</li>

<li>When other blocks break by the result of a previous break, you get a break combo.</li>

<li>Every combo gives you extra points.</li>

<li>If you reach 3 combos in one break your next block is a single explosive block that blows the surrounding blocks.</li>

<li>If you reach 5 combos in one break you next block is a single muticolor star block that match all the blocks.</li>

<li>If you reach 7 combos in one break the 3 bottom lines are cleared.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Music</h2>

<p>Simple, light and soothing.</p>

<h2>Visuals</h2>

<p>Organic and pleasing to the eye. The block shape should be higly regonazible even for color blind people.</p>

<p>Explosion and Combo animation and the sound effects should be rewarding. The player should understand he did something awesome.</p>
