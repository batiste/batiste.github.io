<h1>Pricehubble Full Stack Developer practical Test</h1>

<p>
  You should not spend more than 120 minutes on this task unless you really want to.
  Requisit: a modern browser, a text editor and Python3 installed.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>You should use all the modern feature of JavaScript available in a modern 
      browser: async/await, fetch, fat arrow functions, template strings, etc.</li>
  <li>Using libraries as jQuery or lodash is fine.</li>
  <li>Using heavy library like Angular or React is discouraged unless you feel
    this will not slow you down.</li>
  <li>You don't need to setup a build system for this test.</li>
  <li>Focus on working and clear code rather than finishing all the steps.</li>
  <li>Once you are finished, zip all the files together (6 minimum) and send them back to us.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1</h2>
<!-- Hint: ajax calls with fetch and HTML template with template strings -->

<p>Create a basic HTML file called <code>step1.html</code> with "Github user explorer" as a title. Then 
add a JavaScript tag in there that satisfy the following</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use the github API to fetch data on Linus Torvalds repository (by doing an Ajax call). Here is his repositories:
      <a href="https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/repos">https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/repos</a>.</li>
  <li>Use this data to 
    display a list of links of his repositories using the description and 
    the link to the github page that can be found in the API response.</li>
  <li>Do this request when the page loads the first time.</li>
  <li>Use semantic HTML where it make sense.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Step 2</h2>
<!-- Hint: event listener and cancelling a timeout -->

<p>Copy <code>step1.html</code> to <code>step2.html</code></p>

<p>
  Add an input field in your page that allows you to enter any username.
  The list of repositories should automatically update 1 second after the user has 
  finished typing within the input.
  Display <span style="color:red">an error message</span> if the username doesn't exist (404).
</p>

<h2>Step 3</h2>
<!-- Hint: http.server ? -->

<p>Copy <code>step2.html</code> to <code>step3.html</code></p>

<p>
  Without being authenticated you will quickly reach the Github API rate limitation, and your application will stop working.
  To remediate this problem design a mock API <strong>using Python</strong> that mimicks the Github API user enpoint:
  <code>/users/[username]/repos</code>.</p>

  <p>Each API response should have between 3 to 12 repositories. Values in the necessary fields should
  be filled with random values from a library such as
  <a href="https://pypi.org/project/lorem/">the Python lorem package</a>. 
  You only need to mock the fields that you use, not the whole API.</p>

  <p>Adapt your JavaScript to point to this new endpoint and test things are working properly.</p>
</p>

<h2>Step 4 (optional)</h2>

<p>Copy <code>step3.html</code> to <code>step4.html</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>Improve the look of the page using your own CSS, or any CSS framework of your liking.</li>
  <li>Add small README file explaining how to run the API mock.</li>
  <li>If you feel it is necessary, add some tests.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you and good luck.</p>
