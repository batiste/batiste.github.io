        <p>Dear Atinary Technologies Hiring Team,</p>

        <p>I am writing to express my strong interest in the DevOps Engineer position in Lausanne. With over three years of dedicated experience in DevOps, site reliability, and cloud infrastructure, I am eager to apply my skills to support your cutting-edge AI-driven platform, SDLabs.</p>

        <p>My background aligns perfectly with your requirements, particularly my hands-on proficiency in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cloud Infrastructure: Hands-on experience using, managing and various Cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP).</li>
            <li>Orchestration & IaC: Strong command of Kubernetes, both command line and UX for container orchestration 
                and Terraform for automated provisioning and deployment.</li>
            <li>CI/CD & Scripting: Designing and maintaining robust CI/CD pipelines, complemented by solid programming skills in Python.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I thrive in fast-paced, generalist environments, as demonstrated by my previous roles where I handled everything 
            from backend development to comprehensive DevOps and SRE duties.
            
        <p>The opportunity to shape the infrastructure that accelerates materials discovery through machine learning is highly compelling.</p>

        <p>Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my CV for your review and look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to Atinary’s team.</p>
