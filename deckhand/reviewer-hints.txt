Setup

I think the setup, is not really important to spend much time on.
Even my parents managed to do it by themselves.

Unfolding of the game

1. Maybe important to mention that there will be no start o f turn effect
at the beginning of the game. This phase that is dependant
on buying specific cards (4 possible only in the game).

2. Discard and draw

3. Important to note that you have 2 actions can be any combination of Buy and Play
