        <h2>Video</h2>

        <p style="text-align: center;">
            A quick 10 minutes video to get you started.
        </p>


        <iframe width="660" height="415" style="margin:auto; display: block;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/erDK8WzwB8E?si=Z-TpJ8ox_QxgJ3t5" title="YouTube video player"

        <p>
            Since this video was produced, there have been two small changes that are reflected in your booklet:
            </p>

        <ol>
            <li>The 17 Coin cards have been replaced by 4 Coin cards and 4 Coin Indicator cards. This change simplifies and speeds up wealth tracking.</li>
            <li>Since we added 4 new cards to the game, there is no need to reduce the 4-player supply to 40 cards. It can now be 44 cards, lifting the restriction for 4 players.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px">Simplified Game for Beginners</h2>

        <p>
            To set up a beginner game, you may exclude up to 11 cards for a 2 to 3 player game. 
            No cards can be excluded for a 4-player game and therefor we do not recommend this player count for a first 
            experience with DeckHand.<br>
            Feel free to remove any cards you find complex or that might slow down the game. Here is a suggested list:
        </p>

        <ul class="text-column">
            <li>The Grand Council</li>
            <li>Gold Mine</li>
            <li>Emperor's Caprice</li>
            <li>Imperial Powder</li>
            <li>Typhoon</li>
            <li>Monkey's Bargain</li>
            <li>Governor's Wedding</li>
            <li>Kraken's Fury</li>

            Here are some insights on some of the most distinctive DeckHand cards, including a few that may need further explanation. 
            If you still have any questions about how the game works after reading this, please don't hesitate to
            contact me at <a href="mailto:batiste.bieler@gmail.com">batiste.bieler@gmail.com</a>.
        </p>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/seaside-citadel.png" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    Extra Actions are almost always beneficial, especially when they come
                    with an additional card. If you play Seaside Citadel as your first card, 
                    you will have 3 Actions remaining once fully resolved 
                    (2 starting Actions - 1 to play Seaside Citadel, +2 from the effect). 
                    Actions can be used for playing or buying cards in any order or combination, 
                    and your 2 starting actions are no exception.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep in mind that once you have used 5 actions, which include playing and buying cards, 
                    your turn is over. However, extra Buys you obtain from cards
                    like Haggling (+1 Buy) are not counted as the rules state: "You may buy 1 card <b>without using an Action</b> this turn."
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/wind-in-sails.jpg" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    Wind in Sails is a start-of-turn card that grants you a 4-card draw instead of 3, 
                    simply by sitting in your stash.<br>
                    As the game progresses and your stash grows, its effects continue as long as it remains in your stash.
                    If this card ends up at the bottom of your deck, you may consider it unlucky, 
                    but there's a chance to strategically place it at the bottom of your stash
                    if you play your cards right.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note that if you play Wind in Sails with only one card left in your deck, and decide to draw it, Wind in Sails won't be shuffled back 
                    into your deck. It goes into your stash after resolving all consequences, including the shuffle.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/crafty-coco.jpg" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    Crafty Coco is a card that permanently changes the rules of the game as long as it is in your stash. 
                    Start-of-turn and Rule-change (indicated by the fist icon) cards are cumulative, making them all active at the same time. 
                    The order in which they appear in the stash is inconsequential.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Crafty Coco might be a challenging card to take advantage of unless you start your turn already wealthy
                    or manage to buy a "When discarded" card. In the latter case,
                    you will naturally benefit when it is discarded at the beginning of your next turn.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/fortune-teller.jpg" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    The Fortune Teller opens up possibilities by allowing you to target any deck,
                    whether it's your own, an opponent's, the supply deck, or even the reload deck.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use it strategically
                    to try to obtain what you need, whether it's extra actions, coins, or cards.
                    Additionally, it can be employed to gain insights into an opponent's top cards,
                    enhancing your ability to use cards like Desperate Chase or Voodoo Curse effectively.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/poisoned-grog.jpg" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    The Poisonous Grog is a card that is often better off discarded than played. 
                    You'd consider drinking the Grog yourself only in dire circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The discard effect happens naturally at the beginning of your turn. But 
                    a few cards in DeckHand might enable you to discard Poisoned Grog a little
                    bit sooner (Typhoon, Alchemy, Rum Factory).
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/governor’s-wedding.jpg" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    When you extend a wedding invitation, you anticipate a thoughtful gift in return.
                    But is this complimentary Buy truly worth the coin offering? Your opponent might
                    think otherwise, and your generous invitation might be rudely rejected (by refusing to Buy), 
                    and you will receive no gift in return.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/bewitched-doll.jpg" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    This card exerts quite an intrusive effect on one of your opponents. When you play it, 
                    you gain control of their cards, coins and execute their first Action on their turn. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you generate additional
                    Actions or Buys by this control, you maintain control for those as well if you wish. if you
                    do not the controlled player will have the opportunity to use them.
                    In any case, you must follow valid game rules and not make nonsensical plays. For 
                    Example, it is not allowed to play Karmic Elevation and not pay the coin, or
                    if there is no valid card to swap.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But otherwise, 
                    you have a wide range of possibilities. You could even use the Improvised Grenade on their 
                    own stash. The question is, what kind of damage are you able to inflict to make this 
                    card worth playing?
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/governor’s-jail.jpg" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    Getting 2 coins is already a good deal, but the ability to block a supply card 
                    for a turn opens up multiple strategic possibilities. You can use it to reserve 
                    the card for yourself, preventing an opponent from acquiring it. Additionally, 
                    you can influence any cards that interact with the supply to your advantage.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/monkey’s-bargain.jpg" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    The temptation to remove your weaker base deck cards is strong,
                    but have you considered parting with a higher victory point card? 
                    Your decision hinges on whether you can make the most of those extra 
                    actions. Choose wisely what to trade with the Capuchin monkey.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/gambling-addiction.jpg" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    DeckHand has an equal amount of Attacks, Adventures, and Structures. You could calculate 
                    your odds and make a rational choice, but can a real Pirate ever be truly rational?
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you have 2 reloads, you play them consecutively, and they are always optional.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">

            <img src="cards/improvised-grenade.jpg" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    Consider acquiring Improvised Grenade in the mid-game when opponents have larger 
                    stashes and 2-cost cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be cautious about using it as your first card, as 
                    it can potentially destroy itself if you discard it and you have no better target.
                    This is possible because the discard trigger (<b>When discarded</b>) 
                    happens after the card enters your stash, so keep this in mind to avoid unintended consequences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The card discard effect can be used as a deck thinner, but everybody "benefits". 
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/useless-totem.jpg" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    Useless Totem is maybe not as useless as it looks at first glance. 
                    It has interesting interaction with Tavern, Fortune Teller
                    and any card that cares about card type on the supply such as Adventurer’s Guild
                    or Gambling Addiction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2 victory points for one coin is also a bargain.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/end-of-the-rainbow.jpg" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    When this card is in your stash alongside an Attack and a Structure, you gain extra actions
                    at the beginning of your turn. 
                    However, your opponents may influence your stash and disable it.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/typhoon.jpg" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    Typhoon offers you the chance to pass around a weaker card, 
                    hoping for something better in return. It all depends on your
                    neighbor's stash. In any case, this card allows you to cycle 
                    your deck and provides an opportunity for early discards.
                    As the effect is simultaneous, it does not empty any deck.
                </p>
                <p>When you draw 2 cards, the draws are sequential. Therefor you can choose to draw 0, 1, or 2 cards.</p>
                <p>
                    If the choice of cards to pass around seems to matter
                    (e.g., one player seem to change their card based on another's choice), 
                    as the initiator of the effect, you can decide the exact order in which
                    each player selects a card to pass.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/imperial-powder.jpg" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    Imperial Powder is a highly volatile package, primed to explode at any moment. 
                    The question is, can you dispose of it before the game ends? Perhaps a 
                    Typhoon event will set it off?
                    If that happens, and you pass Imperial Powder to your opponent (losing ownership)
                    you might target Imperial Powder itself for destruction.
                    I'll let you imagine the explosive consequences.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/rum-factory.png" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    What starts like a generous gift might end up causing a heavy hangover.<br>
                    Rum Factory can provide the reach you need to access a desirable card.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alternatively, luck might favor you on the next turn, allowing you to discard
                    a start-of-turn card, already placing it where you want it for your following turn.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/going-ape.jpg" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    Going Ape offers incredible flexibility, allowing you to swap a card
                    from your hand with any other card from the supply of the same cost without consuming an action. 
                    This includes the possibility of swapping Going Ape itself if 
                    it serves your strategy. If you do that Going Ape ends up in the supply
                    and not in your discard.

                <p>A powerful card if you can hit a good card from your opponent.
                    Voodoo Curse can even be played on yourself, but only the most
                    unhinged pirates would do such a thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cards like Voodoo Curse, which do not use the "discard" keyword, 
                    do not trigger the "When discarded" effects of affected cards. 
                    In any case, for a card to be discarded, it has to be in someone's hand.

                    The peculiar wording on Ghost Crew is there to avoid a
                    catastrophic interaction with cards such as Voodoo Curse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the card were to say something simpler like 'on top of your deck,' playing 
                    Voodoo Curse on it would create the opportunity to place it on top of your 
                    own deck, giving you control of it.

                    Everybody reveal a card, then it is your choice to swap one of them.
                    Then all the revealed cards go back on the top of their decks, including the new swapped card.

                    You can gain a powerful effect if your opponent allows it.
                    The two reloads can also prove valuable in combination with other cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If, for any reason, the effect of the chosen card makes it leave the supply, 
                    like in the case of choosing Gambling Addiction and reloading it, the card's 
                    effect continue as long as it remains valid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once a card's effect begins resolution, 
                    it detaches from the card itself and should be brought to its conclusion.

                    Present your opponent with a challenging task: predicting the combined 
                    value of your next 3 cards. If they haven't been closely monitoring your 
                    stash, this could prove quite difficult for them. Should they fail, you
                    strike gold without expending an action.
