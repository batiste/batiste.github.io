        <p>
            Here are some comments on some of the most distinctive DeckHand cards, 
            including a few that require a bit more explanation.
        </p>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/improvised-grenade.jpg" width="220" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    Consider acquiring Improvised Grenade in the mid-game when opponents have larger 
                    stashes and 2-cost cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be cautious about using it as your first card, as 
                    it can potentially destroy itself if you discard it and you have no better target.
                    This is possible because the discard trigger (<b>When discarded</b>) 
                    happens after the card enters your stash, so keep this in mind to avoid unintended consequences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The card discard effect can be used as a deck thinner, but everybody "benefits". 
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/harbor-market.jpg" width="220" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    A boring card that will win you games.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/useless-totem.jpg" width="220" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    Useless Totem is maybe not as useless as it looks at first glance. 
                    It has interesting interaction with Tavern, Fortune Teller
                    and any card that cares about card type on the supply such as Adventurer’s Guild
                    or Gambling Addiction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2 victory points for one coin is also a bargain.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/wind-in-sails.jpg" width="220" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    Wind in Sails is a start-of-turn card that grants you an advantage simply by sitting in your stash. 
                    As the game progresses and your stash grows, its effects accumulate. 
                    If this card ends up at the bottom of your deck, you may consider it unlucky, 
                    but there's a chance to strategically place it at the bottom of your stash
                    if you play your cards right.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note that if you play Wind in Sails with only one card left in your deck, and decide to draw it, Wind in Sails won't be shuffled back 
                    into your deck. It goes into your stash after resolving all consequences, including the shuffle.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/fortune-teller.jpg" width="220" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    The Fortune Teller opens up possibilities by allowing you to target any deck,
                    whether it's your own, an opponent's, the supply deck, or even the reload deck.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use it strategically
                    to try to obtain what you need, whether it's extra actions, coins, or cards.
                    Additionally, it can be employed to gain insights into an opponent's top cards,
                    enhancing your ability to use cards like Desperate Chase or Voodoo Curse effectively.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/poisoned-grog.jpg" width="220" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    The Poisonous Grog is a card that is often better off discarded than played. 
                    You'd consider drinking the Grog yourself only in dire circumstances.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/governor’s-wedding.jpg" width="220" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    When you extend a wedding invitation, you anticipate a thoughtful gift in return.
                    But is this complimentary Buy truly worth the coin offering? The choice is yours to make.

                    However, your generous invitation might be rudely rejected (by refusing to Buy), 
                    and you will receive no gift in return.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/bewitched-doll.jpg" width="220" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    This card exerts quite an intrusive effect on one of your opponents. When you play it, 
                    you gain control of their cards, coins and execute their first Action on their turn. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you generate additional
                    Actions or Buys by this control, you maintain control for those as well if you wish. if you
                    do not the controlled player will have the opportunity to use them.
                    In any case, you must follow valid game rules and not make nonsensical plays. For 
                    Example, it is not allowed to play Karmic Elevation and not pay the coin, or
                    if there is no valid card to swap.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But otherwise, 
                    you have a wide range of possibilities. You could even use the Improvised Grenade on their 
                    own stash. The question is, what kind of damage are you able to inflict to make this 
                    card worth playing?
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/governor’s-jail.jpg" width="220" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    Getting 2 coins is already a good deal, but the ability to block a supply card 
                    for a turn opens up multiple strategic possibilities. You can use it to reserve 
                    the card for yourself, preventing an opponent from acquiring it. Additionally, 
                    you can influence any cards that interact with the supply to your advantage.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/monkey’s-bargain.jpg" width="220" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    The temptation to remove your weaker base deck cards is strong,
                    but have you considered parting with a higher victory point card? 
                    Your decision hinges on whether you can make the most of those extra 
                    actions. Choose wisely what to trade with the Capuchin monkey.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/gambling-addiction.jpg" width="220" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    DeckHand has an equal amount of Attacks, Adventures, and Structures. You could calculate 
                    your odds and make a rational choice, but can a real Pirate ever be truly rational?
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/end-of-the-rainbow.jpg" width="220" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    Three youthful Pirates gazes into the future with hope, dreaming of the day they'll 
                    share their bounty with comrades in all harmony. How naive that dream may be...
                    Your opponents might not let you get away with it.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/typhoon.jpg" width="220" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    Typhoon offers you the chance to pass around a weaker card, 
                    hoping for something better in return. It all depends on your
                    neighbor's stash. In any case, this card allows you to cycle 
                    your deck and provides an opportunity for early discards.
                    As the effect is simultaneous, it does not empty any deck.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the choice of cards to pass around seems to matter
                    (e.g., one player seem to change their card based on another's choice), 
                    as the initiator of the effect, you can decide the exact order in which
                    each player selects a card to pass.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/imperial-powder.jpg" width="220" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    Imperial Powder is a highly volatile package, primed to explode at any moment. 
                    The question is, can you dispose of it before the game ends? Perhaps a 
                    Typhoon event will set it off? If that happens, targeting Imperial Powder 
                    itself is a possible choice. I'll let you imagine the explosive consequences.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/rum-factory.png" width="220" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    What starts like a generous gift might end up causing a heavy hangover.<br>
                    Rum Factory can provide the reach you need to access a desirable card.
                    Alternatively, luck might favor you on the next turn, allowing you to discard
                    a start-of-turn card and activate it without expending an action.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/going-ape.jpg" width="220" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    Going Ape offers incredible flexibility, allowing you to swap a card
                    from your hand with any other card from the supply of the same cost without consuming an action. 
                    This includes the possibility of swapping Going Ape itself if 
                    it serves your strategy. If you do that Going Ape ends up in the supply
                    and not in your discard.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="card-pres">
            <img src="cards/gold-mine.jpg" width="220" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    Present your opponent with a challenging task: predicting the combined 
                    value of your next 3 cards. If they haven't been closely monitoring your 
                    stash, this could prove quite difficult for them. Should they fail, you
                    strike gold without expending an action, and the treasure is yours to enjoy alone.
                </p>
